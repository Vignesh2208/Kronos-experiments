Usleep Test
------------

The purpose of this test is to verify the changes made in clock_gettime
system call of the kernel.

The clk_gettime system calls takes  initial sleep time and also an incremental
timer value for repeated timer events.  We try to set it to different values
and see the accuracy of repeat timers with the changed kernel.


Invoke the test
===============
sudo python runtests.py --script_name=clk_gettime.py --no=4 --tdfactor=3

THre is a wrapper clk_gettime.py, that is called by runtests.py with specified
parameters. There is an array defined at the top in the file clk_gettime.py
which defines the interval timer to be used for different processes that
would be spawned. We can edit these values to see behaviour for different
values.

We have to monitor the log files created to check the clk_gettime values
for the interval timer

(ie) tail -f log0.txt, tail -f log1.txt tail -f log2.txt etc
depending upon the number of process that is spawned.
