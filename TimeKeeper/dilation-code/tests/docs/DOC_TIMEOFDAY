be called.

timeofday Test
------------

The purpose of this test is to verify the dialeted time, due to changes in
the system call time (ie) irrespective of real time elapsed, the processes
registered with Timekeeper, sees the clock advance by a factor of the timeout
that they register with.

It is invoked using the command line
sudo python runtests.py --script_name=timeofday.py --no=4 --tdfactor=2

THere is a C Program gtod.c. This program gets the real time from system
THe C program gtod.c is compiled using gcc

gcc gtod.c -o gtod

THe Python file timeofday internally calls the C executable file 
./gtod

It would print the Real time elapsed, and also the Dilated time elapsed.

From the timekeeper we pass instance ID, which is used to decide
to create time slots of various delays from base slot. 

We have to monitor the log files created to check the time delays.

(ie) tail -f log0.txt, tail -f log1.txt tail -f log2.txt etc
depending upon the number of process that is spawned.
