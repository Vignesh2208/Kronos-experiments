1) runtests.py is the driver program from which the other programs can
be called.

timerfd Test
------------

It is invoked using the command line
sudo python runtests.py --script_name=runtimerfd.py --no=4 --tdfactor=2

The script runtimerfd.py is the wrapper program in python to call the
C program testtimerfd.c.

THe C program is compiled using gcc

gcc testtimerfd.c -o ttimerfd

THis takes 2 command line arguments (viz) Sec, Nanoseconds. THis value
is used in setting the interval timer for firing of the timers.

THe Python file runtimerfd internally calls the C executable file 
./ttimerfd

This finally gets called from Timekeeper. 

From the timekeeper we pass instance ID, which is used to decide
on the timer interval for each of the spawned process.

We have to monitor the log files created to check the time delays.

(ie) tail -f log0.txt, tail -f log1.txt tail -f log2.txt etc
depending upon the number of process that is spawned.
