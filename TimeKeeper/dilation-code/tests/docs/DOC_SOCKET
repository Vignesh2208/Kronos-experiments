1) runtests.py is the driver program from which the other programs can
be called.

select system call
------------

The purpose of this test is to verify the to changes in
the system call select needed for Time Dilation purposes. 
Socket is created by Server and client programs and they communicate 
with each other through socket.

This test is basically to make sure that server & client work as expected.

Invoke Server
==============
sudo python sockserver.py

THe server opens a socket and listens for connection. 
When connection request comes, the server accepts the connection.
It reads the socket, converts the characters to Upper case and sends it back
on the socket.


Invoke client
==============
sudo python sockclient.py

It registers with the Server program, opens the file in the current directory
named sock_testdata, sends it to server.

After that it goes into a loop to read from the socket. The characters
received from the server is printed.
