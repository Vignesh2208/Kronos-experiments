THe command to create Timekeeper module is

(From the DIrectory dilation-code)

sudo make install 

If there is an error,
 sudo make clean
 sudo rmmod TimeKeeper
 sudo make install

1) runtests.py is the driver program from which the other programs can
be called.

Right now this program takes following arguments

log_file
tdfactor
c   : This is the number of the process


2) timeofday

3) sockclient

To be invoked as python sockclient.py

4) sockserver

To be invoked as python sockserver.py


5)  timerfd Test

It is invoked using the command line
sudo python runtests.py --script_name=runtimerfd.py --no=4 --tdfactor=2

The script runtimerfd.py is the wrapper program in python to call the
C program testtimerfd.c.

THe C program is compiled using gcc

gcc testtimerfd.c -o ttimerfd

THis takes 2 command line arguments (viz) Sec, Nanoseconds. THis value
is used in setting the interval timer for firing of the timers.

THe Python file runtimerfd internally calls the C executable file 
./ttimerfd

This finally gets called from Timekeeper. 

From the timekeeper we pass instance ID, which is used to decide
on the timer interval for each of the spawned process.
